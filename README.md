# Simple-Product-Quoting-System-in-Python
Created a simple quoting system for a company I did a co-op for. We spent ages doing quotes by hand. I've learned a bit of coding since then and created this simple system to generate all the information needed to send out product quotes. 
I would like to add a front-end system to load this little program to our web-service, so clients could determine the cost of their order without needing to call in with their questions. I've looked into Clam - any other suggestions?
thanks :)
